<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This application is intended to allow the user to submit a form new cosplay characters with a reference image to a databased and then return it. Initially, the new submissions come in with a status of unfinished—but after they are submitted we can toggle the status from Unfinished to Complete. 

Of course, if a character gets removed from the lineup, we can also delete them from the roster. 

And, if we’re feeling uninspired, at the bottom there’s a listing of the current top 25 anime characters from a popular website called My Anime List which allows users of the site to rank characters. 

### Installation

1. Fork this repository
2. Open up a connection with the json-server
   ```sh
   json-server --watch json.db
   ```
